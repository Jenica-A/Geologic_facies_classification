## Geologic Facies Classification

This project aims to use x-ray fluorescence (XRF) data from rock cores to predict facies lables in a rock core from the Permian Basin in Texas. 

The data are shared with me by AIM GeoAnalytics, a geologic services company in Missoula, MT. 

The XRF data report the elemental composition of a rock. 

The facies lable is short hand for a longer description of the rock type. For example, a rock may be described in many way, such as "very fine sandstone with calcitic cement", or "shale", or "interbedded limestone and shale" and so on. In a rock core description, these descriptions are coded, to be tabularized, and described in a lengthier legend section. The core is then analyzed by a geologist and a lable is given for every half a decifoot (a mind boggling unit, to be sure, but a resolution with its reasons). In a final report, the XRF data are provided along side of the facies description, and a suite of other analyses. 

The lengthiest (read expensive) and perhaps most subjective portion of the description is the facies lable. It is an important step, where a geologist puts her handlense, grainsize card and her bottle of hydrochloric acid to the rock to really understand what has happened, in what sequence in the past. Without this step, the description of a rock, and a resource, can be massively misunderstood or misrepresented, skewing any working model of resource or region and potentially leading to many millions of dollars being misappropriated or lost by an operating company. The unfortunate 

In this project, I attempt to produce a logistic regression classification model that can predict a rock's fac
